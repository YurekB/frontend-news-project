This is the front end side to my NC news project. There is a very basic login and then you can see the articles.
These can be filtered by the 3 different topics or by all. You can sort these by multiple things including votes, title, authorm etc. You can then order this either ascending or descending. You can give articles a vote up or down, immedtiately seeing the change. You can read the comments, add your own and delete any that you have made.
